# Become a Schwifty Student

This repository contains various machine learning models applied to a dataset on student performance. Below are the descriptions of the files:

- **CNN-1.py**: Implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.
- **CNN-2.py**: Enhances the CNN model from `CNN-1.py` by adding early stopping and learning rate reduction.
- **RandomForest.py**: Implements a Random Forest model.
- **FCNN.py**: Implements a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) model.
- **FeatureImportance.py**: Contains code for sorting and displaying the feature importance in a Decision Tree Regressor.

The dataset, `StudentPerformanceFactors.csv`, was sourced from Kaggle. You can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors/data).
